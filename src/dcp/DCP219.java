* Connect 4 is a game where opponents take turns dropping red or black discs into a 7 x 6 vertically suspended grid.
* The game ends either when one player creates a line of four consecutive discs of their color (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally),
* or when there are no more spots left in the grid.
*
* Design and implement Connect 4.
